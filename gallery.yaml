  Our project seeks to query several sports betting websites and collect
  information about pre-game odds, which will be synthesized to produce an
  easily digestible table of helpful details for the user. The program would
  ask which site the user would like to query, then output a nicely formatted
  table including odds, chances of winning, and what the net gain/loss would be
  if the user bet on each option.

  Starting the program will also remind the user to gamble responsibly.
