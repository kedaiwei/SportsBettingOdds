  Our project web scrapes a hub website for sports betting odds and collects
  information about pre-game odds and live-game odds, which will be synthesized 
  to be returned to the user at their request. The program involves a REPL loop 
  that asks the user what league they would like to query, and offers several 
  commands that the user can call such as finding the most contentious matchup 
  based on odds. The interface features case-insensitive input parsing and can 
  be easily expanded to add more features. 

  Starting the program will also remind the user to gamble responsibly.
